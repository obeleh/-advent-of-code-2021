Why I chose for Golang:

In the DevOps / SRE lanscape quite a few tools are written in Golang:
- Kubernetes
- Terraform
- Docker
- Kubernetes Operators
- Prometheus
- Grafana

A good summary of reasons for using golang can be found here https://thechief.io/c/editorial/why-golang-is-widely-used-in-the-devops-and-cloud-native-space/

> Python is a lightweight programming language, but Golang is a lighter-weight programming language by having about 40 times the speed of Python. Though Python might have some advantages over Golang and one of them is its extreme simplicity and a faster learning curve. If you happen to have an automation task, you wonâ€™t be slowed down by Python.

> An advantage of Go compilation is that it compiles directly to the machine code compared to other programming languages that compile to object code. Another advantage is Golang is statically linked, i.e. when a Go program is compiled, it all compiles into a single binary, and no need for external dependencies. Unlike Python, which uses external libraries, the libraries have to be installed on the program's machine. Golang again beats Python with the feature of being perfectly platform-independent as you can run your Go programs on different platforms and with ease.

> Golang performance and runtime also have the edge over Python as it uses fewer resources like CPU, memory, etc.. Golang has a standard built-in library with most of the functionality you need as a DevOps engineer compared to Python, which uses a third-party library.
> If you want to implement fast, learn fast and access to a large community and panel of tools, Python is to-go choice, but if you want efficient programs, Go will be a better choice in most cases.
